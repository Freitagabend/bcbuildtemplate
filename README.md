# Build Settings (build-settings-template.json)

## deployments

There are 3 types of deployment types:

* host

* onlineTenant

* container

Examples:

### host

```
{
    "branch": "refs/heads/main",
    "DeploymentType": "host",  
    "DeployToName": "myVirtualMacine",
    "DeployToInstance": "<blank for default incance>",
    "DeployToTenants": [
        "<blank for all tenants>"
    ],
    "reason": [
        "Schedule",
        "Manual",
        "PullRequest"
    ],
    "InstallNewApps": false
}
```

### onlineTenant

```
{
    "branch": "refs/heads/main",
    "DeploymentType": "onlineTenant",  
    "DeployToName": "Sandbox",
    "DeployToTenants": [
        "24bc1e4f-1a1b-40f8-8987-cd9988f90b4d"
    ]
}
```

### container

```
{
    "branch": "refs/heads/main",
    "DeploymentType": "container",  
    "DeployToName": "myContainer",
    "DeployToTenants": [
        "<blank for all tenants>"
    ]
}
```

### branch
When a pipeline run is triggered the run is marked with a source branch, this setting pecifies what source branch this deployment applies to, in the examples above the deployments will trigger if the run was triggered via the *refs/heads/main* branch.

### DeploymentType
| DeploymentType | Description                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------|
| onlineTenant   | Deploy to a SaaS enviroment                 |
| container      | Deploy to a Docker container.               |
| host           | Deploy to a Virtual Machine or Server host. |

### DeployToTenants
TenantId/s or tenant name/s in which you want to publish the Per Tenant Extension Apps.

Depending on Deployment Type this setting is used differently.

| DeploymentType | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| onlineTenant   | TenantId/s in the SaaS environment in which you want to publish the Per Tenant Extension Apps.                                                                                        |
| container      | TenantId name/s in the container in which you want to publish the Per Tenant Extension Apps.<br/>If left empty deployment will apply to all tenants in the Server Instance.           |
| host           | Tenant name/s the environment on your Host in which you want to publish the Per Tenant Extension Apps.<br/>If left empty deployment will apply to all tenants in the Server Instance. |

You can specify multiple tenants by using a JSON Array litteral.

Examples:

```
// Single tenant for host and container deployment
"DeployToTenants": [
    "Tenant1"
],

// Multiple tenants for host and conainter deployment
"DeployToTenants": [
    "Tenant1",
    "Tenant2"
],

// All tenants for host and conainter deployment
"DeployToTenants": [],

// Single tenant for onlineTenant deployment
"DeployToTenants": [
    "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
], 

// Multiple tenants for onlineTenant deployment
"DeployToTenants": [
    "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
],
```
### DeployToName
Depending on Deployment Type this setting is used differently.

| DeploymentType | Description                                                                                          |

### DeployToInstance
Only applies to Deployment Type **host**. Specifies in which ServerInstance you want to publish the Per Tenant Extension Apps. If left empty the pipeline will try to use the default serverinstance on the host.

### Reason
You can filter your deployment by specifying reasons as a JSON Array litteral. The events that are reported by DevOps can be found here [[Predefined variables - Azure Pipelines | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#build-variables-devops-services)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#build-variables-devops-services).

If left empty or if you omit reasons the pipeline will deploy no mather what reason triggered the run.

### InstallNewApps
Only applies to Deployment Type **host.**
Default value is false.
If specified and the app is not already installed in the tenant or Server Instance, the pipline will try to install the app after succsefully publishing the app.
# Publish Sync-NAVApp Mode Parameter
